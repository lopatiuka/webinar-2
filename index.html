                                We’ve all been intrigued by the magic which surrounds the financial markets and we wish that one day we 
                                will be able to “Crack” this code and become big traders like George Soros, warren Buffet and others 
                                which are big players in this field.</br>
                            </br>
                                As much as we would like to achieve it, the reality is different and requires dedication and knowledge 
                                to achieve success in this field of trading, investing and more.</br>
                            </br>
                                If you feel that this is the right time for you to grab this bull by it’s horns and start your journey 
                                of trading then this is the right place and time! Allow us to introduce you to our Mentor, Adam Peter 
                                Harris, from “Learn With Adam”.</br>
                            </br>
                                <span>So who is Adam?</span>
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                Adam Harris transitioned to trading the financial markets in 2008, after he sold his successful 
                                post-production film company and moved to London from South Africa.  This previous career in visual 
                                effects provided him with a solid foundation for technical software, and skills requiring both artistic 
                                and scientific approaches.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class = "about-bottom">
                        Adam’s change of career led him to focus on trading as it solved several personal needs - the ability to work 
                        from anywhere in the world, provided no income ceiling, and was largely recession proof. His re-education 
                        covered several programs in London, progressing to trading his own capital and finally to include client funds.
                        Adam applies a blend of both traditional, discretionary trading as well as algorithmic strategies.</br>
                    </br>
                        As trading regulated funds only occupies a small portion of Adam’s daily life, he also provides technical 
                        analysis content through Trade With Precision for a select few institutions globally, such as the Futures 
                        Institute division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (C.M.E.), the Intercontinental Exchange (I.C.E.),  
                        and mentors a limited number of individuals each year. He attributes his success to taking advantage of 
                        opportunities across different asset classes including, Stocks, Currencies, Commodities, Bonds and Indices. 
                        Adam looks forward to bringing his real-world trading experience, technical analysis expertise and unique 
                        mentoring techniques to an exclusive client base.</br>
